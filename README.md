# HERA SPICE WEBSOCKET SERVER
This program provides SPICE kernel data on request via WebSockets for real-time 3D simulations. It fetches and updates CSPICE kernels from an HTTPS server, processes trajectory and orientation data, and serves it efficiently using multi-threaded C++. Designed for smooth integration with visualization tools.
